abstract: >-
  The module is a codebase for a Rice D2K (Data to
  Knowledge) Lab capstone project, in partnership with the
  Baylor College of Medicine. The project investigates the
  impact of neighborhood-level factors, namely the Child
  Opportunity Index (COI) and exposure to artificial light
  at night (ALAN), on children's growth trajectories and
  probability of becoming overweight or obese.
